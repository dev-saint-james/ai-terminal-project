\# Project: AI in the Terminal – Starter



Goal:

\- Learn how to control AI from the terminal instead of only the browser.

\- Use AI to help with my real projects (clothes, Jiu-Jitsu, business, etc.).



What AI should know about me:

\- I’m new to terminals and coding.

\- I want clear, simple explanations and step-by-step instructions.

\- I’m on Windows and using ChatGPT Plus.



How I want AI to help:

\- Explain what’s happening in plain language.

\- Help me plan and organize tasks in this folder.

\- Slowly teach me how to automate and code without overwhelming me.
